# **Sales Data Analysis and Reporting for a Retail Chain**

Welcome to the final project of my internship: **Sales Data Analysis and Reporting for a Retail Chain** using **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI**. This project showcases a comprehensive approach to analyzing retail sales data, leveraging a combination of tools and techniques to derive actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## ðŸŒŸ **Project Overview**
The **Sales Data Analysis and Reporting** project aims to provide a deep understanding of customer behavior and sales performance for a retail chain. Utilizing Python for statistical analysis and data manipulation, SQL for efficient data querying, and Excel and Power BI for dynamic visualization, this project offers a multifaceted view of the sales data, enabling informed decisions on inventory management, marketing strategies, and growth opportunities.

## **Key Features of the Project**

### **1. Data Collection and Database Setup**
- **Database Creation:** Established a new database (`Retail_db`) and created two tables: `Retail_Data_Transactions` and `Retail_Data_Response`.
- **Data Display:** Queried and displayed all data to ensure correct setup and structure.

### **2. Data Cleaning, Preparation, and Analysis**
- **Indexing:** Optimized query performance using indexing on `customer_id`.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Cleaned data by updating missing `tran_amount` values to `0`.
- **Outlier Removal:** Utilized the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to remove outliers, ensuring robust analysis.
- **Aggregations and Filtering:** Calculated total sales, average transaction amounts, and other key metrics per customer.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouped customers based on total spending to identify high-value customer groups.

### **3. Advanced Analysis Techniques**
- **RFM Analysis:** Implemented Recency, Frequency, and Monetary analysis to classify customers into segments like "Best Customer," "Loyal Customer," etc.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation:** Predicted total revenue expected from each customer over their relationship duration.
- **Churn Prediction:** Identified at-risk customers using transaction inactivity metrics.
- **Cohort Analysis:** Tracked customer behavior over time based on their first purchase date to calculate retention rates.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Prepared data for future sales predictions by aggregating sales by year and month.

### **4. Additional Calculations and Enhancements**
- **Date Component Extraction:** Extracted day, month, and year from transaction dates to enhance time-based analysis.
- **Segmentation Based on Transaction Status:** Classified transactions as high, medium, or low based on transaction amounts.

### **5. Reporting and Insights**
- **Total Sales:** Calculated total sales for the entire project period.
- **Top Customers:** Identified top 5 customers by sales performance.
- **Sales by Year:** Determined highest and lowest sales values recorded for specific years.
- **Customer Recency Analysis:** Analyzed most recent and oldest purchase dates for customers.
- **Segment Analysis:** Evaluated sales distribution across various customer segments.

## **Results and Visualizations**

### **Power BI Dashboard**

## **Tools and Technologies Used**
- **Python:** For data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL:** For database setup, querying, and advanced analysis.
- **Excel:** For creating dynamic dashboards and data visualization.
- **Power BI:** For interactive, dynamic data visualization and dashboards.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how combining Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI can provide valuable insights into retail sales data. It showcases the power of data-driven analysis to optimize inventory management, tailor marketing strategies, and identify growth opportunities, reflecting real-world business applications.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
